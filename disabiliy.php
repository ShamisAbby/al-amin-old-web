            <h3><center>DISABILITY PEOPLE</center></h3>
            <p>
               It is not uncommon for large African societies to hide people with disabilities inside and see if the presence of children is a mistake in their lives something that just keeps them inside without even involving them in social events. 
               In a State in which AL.  Amin does not agree with some of the parents.
               We support alternatives that can help a person with a disability to participate in social events.  
               The items are wheelchair, sunglasses, walking shoes, walking sticks e.t.c. 
               Our partner join us in every step of helping people with disabilities to join us as usual
